# Caesar Cipher Decoder
This program decodes messages that were encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Rather than manually guessing keys, this decoder will output the english message for you.

## Example

Output: If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.
